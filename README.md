As a beginner developer, I created a simple tic-tac-toe game. In this project, I used hypertext markup language for website structuring, and also applied CSS for styling the page and elements. However, the main part of the project is the game logic, in which I utilized JavaScript programming language. It provided me with full control over the page elements and the ability to write logical scenarios. For positioning the elements, I used flexbox layout, applying flex-direction: column to achieve the desired result. This is my first independent project, and I am satisfied with the work done.
